# K-means clustering EViews add-in

- This repository contains the add-in used to implement k-means clustering in EViews
- The implementation is heavily sourced from the k-means lectures in Andrew Ng's Stanford machine learning Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/93VPG/k-means-algorithm)

## Core folders/files:

- ./kmeans.prg is the EViews program that executes the k-means clustering routine
- ./unit_tests is a folder containing programs that call the file to test scalability/accuracy
